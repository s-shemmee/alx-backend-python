---

## ✅ Task 3: Leverage Advanced ORM Techniques for Threaded Conversations
**Status: COMPLETED**

- ✅ Modified Message model with parent_message field (self-referential FK)
- ✅ Used prefetch_related and select_related for query optimization
- ✅ Implemented recursive queries for threaded message display
- ✅ Created enhanced ChatMessage model for complex threading

**Files**: `chats/models.py` (Conversation and ChatMessage models)

---

## ✅ Task 4: Custom ORM Manager for Unread Messages
**Status: COMPLETED**

- ✅ Added read boolean field to Message model
- ✅ Implemented UnreadMessagesManager custom manager
- ✅ Used .only() for field optimization
- ✅ Custom manager filters unread messages for specific users

**Files**: `messaging/models.py` (UnreadMessagesManager and Message model)

---

## ✅ Task 5: Implement Basic View Cache
**Status: COMPLETED**

- ✅ Updated settings.py with LocMemCache configuration
- ✅ Applied @cache_page decorator to conversation view
- ✅ Set 60-second cache timeout as required
- ✅ Cache-aware templates with user feedback

**Files**: `messaging_app/settings.py`, `chats/views.py`

---

## ✅ Task 6: Manual Review
**Status: READY FOR REVIEW**

All code is documented, tested, and ready for manual quality assurance review.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Django Signals
- **post_save**: Automatic notification creation
- **pre_save**: Message edit history logging  
- **post_delete**: User data cleanup
- **Best Practices**: Lean handlers, proper registration, exception handling

### Advanced ORM Techniques
- **select_related()**: Foreign key optimization with JOINs
- **prefetch_related()**: Many-to-many and reverse FK optimization
- **Prefetch()**: Custom prefetch with optimized querysets
- **only()**: Field limitation for memory efficiency
- **annotate()**: Computed fields with aggregations
- **Custom Managers**: Encapsulated query logic

### Caching Implementation
- **View-level caching**: @cache_page decorator
- **LocMemCache backend**: Development-ready cache configuration
- **60-second timeout**: As per requirements
- **Cache management**: Utilities for cache clearing

### Database Design
- **Threaded conversations**: Self-referential foreign keys
- **User notifications**: Automated through signals
- **Edit history**: Complete audit trail
- **Optimized queries**: Reduced N+1 problems

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Signal functionality tests
- ✅ ORM optimization validation
- ✅ Custom manager testing
- ✅ Threaded conversation logic
- ✅ Cache behavior verification

### Demo Script Results
